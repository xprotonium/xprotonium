# Hey there, I'm Ali!

I'm a student at **Multimedia University**, currently in my foundation year.

## What I'm up to
- Diving deep into **Python**, **Web Frontend**, and **Backend** development  
- Building cool stuff as I learn — one commit at a time  
- Constantly leveling up my coding game

## Goals
- Become a full stack wizard who can bring any idea to life  
- Master the tools that power the web and beyond

Feel free to check out my repos and follow along my journey!
